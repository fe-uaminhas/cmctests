### How to Run?

Before running this project, ensure following pre-reqs:

  - your IDE is setup - I used **IntelliJ IDEA** to write and execute these steps 
  - maven (I used through IDE)
  - webdriver (Firefox or Chrome) in your PATH.

Once the environment is ready just click the .feature file you want to run. For example, if you want to execute **backend** tests then;
 - goto the file directory of Intellij IDEA
 - in resources dir features are present 
 - locate backend.feature file, right click then select "Run"
 - Tests execution will be started and tests results will also be displayed 
 - Included my own execution videos ;)
